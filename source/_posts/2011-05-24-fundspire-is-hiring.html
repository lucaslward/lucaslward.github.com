The title says it all.  Things are going very well here at Fundspire, and we're looking to expand.  You can find more information here: <a href="http://www.fundspire.com/careers/">http://www.fundspire.com/careers/</a><br /><br />Just because I can be a bit more narrative here.  We're using the following technologies: Grails, Ext Js, Spring Batch running on Amazon EC2.  Of course, it would be great to find someone with experience in all of those technologies, but it never works out that way.  A solid Java developer experienced with Spring and Hibernate would also be great.  And of course the most important skill of all, a developer that tests the code they write, not with a debugger, but by writing tests.<br /><br />If you think you might be interested (or know someone who might be) please apply via the link above, or send your resume to jobs@fundspire.com</div>
