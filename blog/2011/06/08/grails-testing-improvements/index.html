Peter Ledbrook put up a new blog post detailing some of the improvements to come 1.4 for unit testing grails: <a href="http://blog.springsource.com/2011/06/07/countdown-to-grails-1-4-unit-testing/">http://blog.springsource.com/2011/06/07/countdown-to-grails-1-4-unit-testing/</a><br /><br />There&#8217;s some awesome stuff in there. I had read a bit about the new features in milestone 1. But it didn&#8217;t show the kind of details that Peter has. I&#8217;m especially excited about these two features:<br /><ol><li>Full Gorm testing. It looks like they&#8217;re using some kind of noSQL database in-memory. I&#8217;m interested to see if it will slow down the unit test at all, but the method of testing is much more intuitive. The whole mockDomain(Class,listOfInstances) felt a bit dirty, and it was kind of brittle if you used any kind of inheritance at all.</li><li>Improved JSON response testing. Grails now does the work in the mock response of converting the JSON response to a proper object hierarchy. In my own testing, I could get halfway there by converting the responseText to JSONObjects, but they were a bit painful to work with at times. (especially arrays)<br /></li></ol>Those two fixes represent for me the only real issues I have with grails unit testing. The annotations are nice, but I had given up on the test hierarchy long ago. You can use MockUtils easily in the same way that GrailsUnitTest does.<br /><br />That leaves only one major complaint for me regarding testing and Grails: Integration testing. Its nice that they found ways to allow for using unit testing more often, but it doesn&#8217;t solve the fundamental problem. Integration testing takes too long because you have to start the world. Lately I&#8217;ve been working a lot with ElasticSearch, and I refused to put it in the Integration test folder and rely on the bootstrap. In the test setup I brought up an in-memory ElasticSearch instance and test against it. Its definitely an integration test, but I can run it in about 6 seconds. It takes longer than that for Grails to resolve dependencies. (Which is something I hear they&#8217;re addressing in 1.4) Its all perfectly fine for CI, but you can&#8217;t use it to test on the fly. Its far too tempting to do a run-war and fiddle with it that way. It seems like it wouldn&#8217;t be too difficult to bring up a persistent integration testing environment. In truth, it would probably still be some kind of headless container that you could keep running integration tests in without having to restart the container. I&#8217;ve seen a few other Grails bloggers mention it though, so perhaps its on the roadmap somewhere? Maybe post 1.4?</div>

Graeme,<br /><br />I&#39;ve tried that once or twice before and its still was too slow to run it reliably. I know one issue you&#39;re addressing is dependency resolution, but what are the other issues to speed it up in interactive mode in 1.4?<br /><br />I still kind of wish I could start an integration environment in something like Jetty with an overlay, and just runs tets, which perhaps under the covers are either JMX or &#39;web service&#39; calls to run tests in the container and report back results.</div>

For speeding up integration testing we recommend using interactive mode which is greatly improved in 1.4. In 1.3.x you can do:<br /><br />{code}<br />grails interactive<br />{code}<br /><br />Then type test-app, but it has a few issues which we&#39;re addressing in 1.4</div>
