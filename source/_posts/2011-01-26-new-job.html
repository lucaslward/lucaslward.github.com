This post should have been made a month ago, so I apologize for the delay.  However, last month I left <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks</a> to pursue an opportunity a start-up called <a href="http://www.fundspire.com">Fundspire</a>.  I have accepted the position of CTO there and will be leading the technical direction of the software.  It's a small company, so that's really a fancy way of saying that I'll be the one coding.  I plan to continue blogging and contributing to open source, with the same blessing from Fundspire as I received from ThoughtWorks.  The Fundspire solution has been implemented in Grails on Amazon EC2, so there should be more posts in the future around those technologies.</div>

Thanks for the heads up Roshan.  I&#39;m still getting a handle on the new codebase.  The messaging issues you mentioned are fixed and will be in our next release.</div>
