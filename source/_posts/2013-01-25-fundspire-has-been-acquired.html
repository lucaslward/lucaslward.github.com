This is definitely a bit belated, however, I wanted to announce on my blog that my startup, Fundspire, was acquired by Evestment last <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/evestment-acquires-pertrac-fundspire-140000958.html" target="_blank">November</a>. Nothing much changes for me day to day, and I'm hopeful that it will allow more time to blog and work on my open source projects. I still very much need to get the grails envers plugin in the official repo and upgraded to support the latest versions of grails.</div>
