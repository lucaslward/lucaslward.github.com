First: Watch this hilarious VW spot on YouTube: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R55e-uHQna0">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R55e-uHQna0</a><br /><br />Second: Press the share button below the clip.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Skp1fAaSV2U/TUuW9YsQySI/AAAAAAAAAAU/-YDH6R6CVOo/s1600/Screen%2Bshot%2B2011-02-03%2Bat%2B11.57.22%2BPM.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 184px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Skp1fAaSV2U/TUuW9YsQySI/AAAAAAAAAAU/-YDH6R6CVOo/s400/Screen%2Bshot%2B2011-02-03%2Bat%2B11.57.22%2BPM.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5569711345518037282" /></a><br /><br />On the top we've got how many people shared this link on twitter, facebook or buzz.  Do we really care about that?<br /><br />Then the most important bit, the actual link, which we can shorten.  Although I don't know why, doing so cuts the size down by 25%.  I've always thought YouTube links were some of the simplest out there: youtube.com?watch?v=SomeRandomNumber.  "Shortening" it turns it into: youtu.be/SomeRandomNumber.  Go Belgium I guess.<br /><br />And then there's no less than 9 places I can share it.  Half of them I haven't heard of.  And really, Myspace?<br /><br />Can I just have a link?</div>
